<h1 id="toc_0"><p align="center">Final Exam: Sex-ratio selection and nest site choice in TSD turtles</p></h1>

<p align="center"><b>BEFORE STARTING THE ASSIGNMENT, PLEASE READ ALL OF THE INSTRUCTIONS</b></p>

<h6 id="toc_1">Due Monday December 4th by 3:30PM. As stated in the Final Exam overview video, you may use any class materials, your class notes, your textbooks, and online resources. Still, the exam must be taken entirely ON YOUR OWN. Your TA and I will still hold our office hours during the last week of classes as well as EXTRA special office hours. You are encouraged to direct questions to us either during these times or via email or on MS Teams. DO NOT show the exam, discuss it, or work on it with anyone else. Consulting any external resources, such as an online forum, is PROHIBITED. However, you may use ChatGPT (please turn in your conversation with your assignment). As per the syllabus, any violations will result on a zero on the final and may result in an F in the course! No late exams will be accepted, no exceptions.</h6>

<p><p></p>

<h2 id="toc_2">Prerequisites</h2>

<ul>
<li>This final project is comprehensive of the entire course. So you should already have completed all four modules and associated capstones before getting started.

<ul>
<li>The cheat sheets you made throughout the semester should come in real handy for your final exam<br></li>
</ul></li>
<li>For this assignment, you are allowed to use the internet, so you should watch the pre-recorded video on effective internet searching before getting started.</li>
<li>You should have completed Lab 9 or at the very least gone through the key for that assignment to make sure you are comfortable with the learning objectives.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="toc_3">Learning Goals</h2>

<ul>
<li>This project is meant to challenge you in the same way as other capstone projects during the semester, but because it is comprehensive, it is an opportunity to put all of the pieces of the course together to test your knowledge and see how far you have come this semester!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="toc_4">Learning Objectives</h2>

<h5 id="toc_5">As a comprehensive assignment, the learning objectives of this assignment are the same as those for the course as a whole (copied directly from the syllabus):</h5>

<ul>
<li>Learn basic LINUX/UNIX command line utilities</li>
<li>Generate quick one- and multi-line scripts for data analysis</li>
<li>Develop basic programming skills in shell and R</li>
<li>Get exposed to git and github for reproducibility and version control</li>
<li>Construct regular expressions for parsing text and pattern matching</li>
<li>Perform basic statistical analysis of biological data using R</li>
<li>Produce publication quality graphics using R and Illustrator</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="toc_6">Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h5 id="toc_7">Evolutionary theory predicts that a balanced sex ratio should be maintained by frequency-dependent selection. Organisms with environmental sex determination, however, are vulnerable to maladaptive sex ratios, because environmental conditions vary spatio-temporally. For reptiles with temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD), nest-site choice is a behavioural maternal effect that could respond to sex-ratio selection, as mothers could adjust offspring sex ratios by choosing nest sites that will have particular thermal properties. The data you will be using for this exam was collected to directly test the hypothesis that females choose nest sites to alter the incubation temperature, perhaps influencing the sex-ratio of their offspring. To measure nest site temperature, physiological <a href="http://www.ibuttonlink.com/collections/temperature-logging-ibuttons">devices</a> have been placed in the nests that record throughout the day. The researchers compared recorded temperatures of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Painted_turtle">painted turtles</a> from maternally selected nest sites with those from randomly selected nest sites. Your job is to process the raw temperature data from the nests to determine whether maternal nests have different incubation temperatures than random nests.</h5>

<h3 id="toc_8">Part A: Your objective is to write a script to process the raw temperature data from the two experimental treatments. The script should be written to execute using bash. The script will be designed to do the following operations on a set of input files. (30pts)</h3>

<ol>
<li><p>Make a directory on your computer (or ASC) titled YOUR_LAST_NAME_Final. Make a subdirectory named PartA. For this part of the exam, you will be working with the following <a href="https://auburn.instructure.com/files/224786730/download?download_frd=1">tarball</a>. Use <code>tar</code> to uncompress this file into your current working directory. There are several files here you will need to complete this exam. </p></li>
<li><p>Open a text editor and make a shell script titled YOUR_LAST_NAME_PartA.sh. Add a shebang line. </p></li>
<li><p>The first thing you want to do is extract the list of nests from the <code>metadata.csv</code> file. Store the list of nests in an array variable. (2 pts)</p></li>
<li><p>The files you will be working with are raw outputs from the temperature sensors. From 22 May to 17 June 2010, the researchers monitored the Thomson Causeway Recreation Area in Thomson, Illinois, USA. They excavated eggs from the top of a nest within approximately 12 h of oviposition, and placed eggs in containers filled with moist soil, and stored them in Styrofoam boxes. For each focal nest, they constructed two artificial nest chambers to identical dimensions to be the same depth as the original nest. Then, they placed each nest in either the ‘maternal’ treatment nearby the original nest location or the ‘random’ treatment randomly placed across the field site. The corresponding files are labeled with the nest number and either an <code>f</code> for maternal or and an <code>r</code> for random. Use <code>ls</code> and <code>less</code> to take a look at the files in your directory and examine one or two to get a sense of the file format.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do NOT open these files using a text editor to avoid editing them by accident!</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>The files you have are not comprehensive of all the nests in the metadata file. Some nests were predated and the sensors were lost. Therefore, your loop should <em>count how many nests have been sampled</em> based on the <code>metadata.csv</code> file and setup the loop to run this many times. (5 pts)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Note that the researcher who has done this experiment needs a script that will continue to work when she gets more data. Therefore, it should NOT be hard coded to a specific number of nests!</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Once you&#39;ve setup your loop, make sure each nest listed in the metadata file has a <strong>pair</strong> of files from both treatments in your directory. To do this, <em>make a variable</em> for BOTH the experimental and control nest filenames based on their naming conventions in the tarball provided.</p></li>
<li><p>Next, use the variables assigned in #6 to perform a <strong>sanity check</strong> that both files exist and are not empty. If any nest does not have files for BOTH treatments, skip that nest and <em>print an error to the researcher</em>. Also, if any of the files has an error in the file name itself, skip the nest as well. (5 pts)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Note: you do NOT need to differentiate between missing files and files with errors in the names.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Within the body of your loop, you will extract the raw data for each nest file that has a properly paired set of files. First, make a master file that you will eventually import into <code>R</code> in Part B. Your <strong><em>final output should have 5 columns</em></strong>: Date, Time, Temperature, Nest, Treatment. Initialize this file by printing a <strong><em>tab-delimited header</em></strong> to an output file named <code>Nest_Temps.txt</code>. (1 pt)</p></li>
<li><p>Before extracting the raw data, you will need to remove the log data towards the end of each file. Integrate this quick one-liner in awk into your script to extract only the middle section of each file.   </p>

<div><pre><code class="language-shell">awk &#39;/^Log Data/,/^Debug Dump/&#39;</code></pre></div></li>
<li><p>Even after adding the one-liner from awk, you will notice that you still need to clean up the first and last few lines to get just the log data. Use regular expressions you have learned throughout the class to do this. You may pipe the output of the one-liner in #9 to this regular expression to avoid making temp files. (2 pts)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Remember: simple solutions are ALWAYS better than complicated solutions.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Finally, in the master file combining all the nest data, you will need to add both the nest number and the treatment group - either &quot;maternal&quot; or &quot;control&quot; - each as a column in your final output. This way, when you read this dataset into R, you can use these columns to perform statistics and make plots based on these experimental variables. As in #10, you may pipe the output of your growing one-liner into this command to avoid making temp files. (Final output file  - 5 pts)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A correctly working script that is NOT hard coded to any specific files for Part A (10 pts) is critical to get the expected results for Parts B &amp; C, so ensure your script is working as expected before moving on. DO NOT DO THIS PART IN EXCEL!!!</p>

<p>Note: if you are doing this on the ASC, you should submit your script to the class queue. I would suggest starting with 500MB, 1 CPU, and 30 minutes of run time. </p>
</blockquote></li>
</ol>

<h3 id="toc_9">Part B: For this part of the exam, you will be asked to read the data you generated in Part A into R. Use what you have learned towards to end of the semester to ensure the graphics you produce are of the quality that you would feel confident including them in a scientific publication as is. (40pts)</h3>

<ol>
<li><p>Move up to your main directory and make a new subdirectory called PartB. Open a session of RStudio and make this PartB directory your working directory. Start a script named YOUR_LAST_NAME_PartB.R. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Note: you may choose to do Part A on the ASC and Parts B+C on your local computer. Make sure to download your work from the ASC to include it with your final tarball/zip file to upload to canvas!</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Read your output file <code>Nest_Temps.txt</code> from Part A into R. Make sure to specify that this file is tab-delimited and that it has a header. Check to make sure your script in Part A worked correctly now before continuing. For example, you should not have any negative values for date. (1 pt)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Note: Use what you have learned throughout the semester to make a test file that matches the format of the expected <code>Nest_Temps.txt</code> file so that you can start your R code early to help progress the project when you get stuck at any part in Part A.</p>

<p>Note: use what you learned in Lab 7 to check the class of each vector in the data set is formatted as expected and to get a summary of the data to ensure it looks as expected.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Now we will continue to manipulate the data here in R before plotting. First, you&#39;ll notice the dates are in conventional format (e.g. 07/23/2010). But in the metadata file, these are in &#39;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_day">Julian day</a>&#39; format. You will need to <strong>convert these conventional dates into julian calendar format</strong> to make analysis and downstream plotting easier. For this, I have provided the R function <code>date_calc</code> below. Add this function to your script. (1 pt)</p>

<div><pre><code class="language-R">date_calc=function(date_in) {
parsed=strptime(date_in, &quot;%m/%d/%Y&quot;)
fixed=format(parsed,&quot;%Y-%m-%d&quot;)
julian(as.Date(x=fixed),origin=as.Date(&quot;2010-01-01&quot;))+1
}</code></pre></div></li>
<li><p>Next, add a new vector to your data frame that will return the converted Julian date for each date in your dataset using the function above. (2 pts) </p></li>
<li><p>Additionally, the researcher who collected these data pointed out that there was uncertainty around the start and end date and that some of the temperature readings in the first two and last two days may be incorrect. Therefore, for each nest you will need to remove the first two days and the last two days of temperature readings to ensure that they are correct. You will notice that each nest was started at a different time, but all the sensors were removed on the same date, 204. Therefore, you should be able to <strong>remove the last two days from all nests</strong> without the metadata file. This will remove all data from 48 hours BEFORE the Excavation Date. (1 pt)</p></li>
<li><p>To remove the <strong>first two days from each nest</strong>, you will need to <strong>read the metadata file into R</strong> (1 pt). Then, using the &quot;Oviposit date&quot; column, you can remove any data collected in the first 48 hours from each nest. You may find that you need to set up a loop in R to accomplish this task. You may also use any packages you have learned this semester. (6 pts)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Note: While this step is more computationally challenging, it is also only worth 6 points in the final rubric (~8% of your grade). To save time, you are welcome to skip this step. </p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Now that your data is finally cleaned up, you are ready to start doing summary statistics. First, calculate the mean temperature for each treatment. Store each mean calculation in an object. (3 pts)</p></li>
<li><p>Next, make a histogram of temperature for each treatment. Plot both histograms with the same x and y limits so they can be easily compared (5 pts). Add the mean calculations from #7 to these plots colored red. Be sure to round these values to two decimal places. (2 pts)</p></li>
<li><p>Next, compare these distributions side by side by making a boxplot of temperature based on treatment. (4 pts)</p></li>
<li><p>Run a statistical test to see if these treatment groups are significantly different. Add the p-value from this test to your plot in red. (3 pts)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Note: you have learned several statistical tests in R this semester. Because this is not a stats class, you will not be graded on your ability to choose the appropriate test. Instead, you may choose the test you FEEL is more appropriate for this data. For grading, we will focus on whether you did the test right in R and the extracted p-value is correctly added to the plot. </p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Create a PNG formatted for two columns (190mm) of a scientific publication at 300dpi resolution. Now, plot all three plots from above side-by-side in a single row with three columns. There should be two properly formatted histograms and the boxplot (2 pts). Be sure to include the mean calculations on your histograms and the p-value on your boxplot. Each plot should also have a descriptive title (1 pt).</p></li>
<li><p>Next, you will examine how temperature varied throughout the experiment. To do this, you will need to do a quick manipulation to calculate the mean temperature of all nests and all time points for each day based on treatment. Below is sample code to help accomplish this task (you can do this another way if prefered). Store the result in an object.</p>

<div><pre><code class="language-none">tapply(data$Temperature,list(data$Julian.Date,data$Treatment),mean)</code></pre></div>

<blockquote>
<p>Note: depending on how you have named the Julian date column and the main dataset object in R, you may need to modify this line of code to get it to work in your script.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Now, using this new object, make a line graph of the mean temperatures with the julian date on the x-axis and the temperature on the y-axis (4 pts). Color each line and add a legend (2 pts). Give this plot a title.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Note: the x-axis labels of the dates are part of the names of each row. This information is not formally a vector in this object.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Write the plot from above to a JPG formatted for publication to span a single column of a scientific publication (90mm, 300dpi). This should be readable to your audience, so make adjustments as needed to the graphing parameters to make it readable. (2 pts)</p></li>
</ol>

<h3 id="toc_10">Part C: You will have until the beginning of finals week to complete this exam. It is due by 3:30PM on Monday, December 4th. No late exams will be accpeted, no exceptions.</h3>

<ol>
<li><p>Make a tarball or zip file of your main directory containing both PartA and PartB subdirectories. This should not include any temp files, but it should include your working scripts for both parts A and B as well as the plots you made. It MUST include your output from Part A and input for Part B - <code>Nest_Temps.txt</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Upload your compressed file to canvas. </p></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="toc_11">Reflection Questions (5 pts)</h2>

<h5 id="toc_12">Lastly, respond to the following reflection questions, and upload your responses titled <code>LASTNAME_reflection.txt</code> to canvas along with the tarball from Part C. Take a moment to reflect on the analysis you did in Parts A &amp; B and re-read over the goal of the experimental data you have just processed. Then, answer the following questions regarding your own interpretation of the results of your analysis. (5 pts):</h5>

<ol>
<li><p>In this species, females construct nests in early summer; their eggs incubate and hatchlings hibernate within the nests until emerging the following spring. They have TSD and a thermosensitive period (the period when sex is labile) during embryonic development. During this time, warmer temperatures produce females, cooler temperatures produce males and a narrow range of temperatures produces both sexes. Based on your analysis of these data in Part B, if the researchers were to measure the resulting sex-ratio in the hatchlings from the maternal and random nests, would there be a difference in sex-ratio? Explain your answer and be sure to refer to why your results support your conclusion. (2 pts) </p></li>
<li><p>What aspects of the habitat do you think could influence nesting behavior to lead to the results you found in Part B? (1 pt)</p></li>
<li><p>While you could argue that maternal nesting behavior is one possible way for these turtles to cope with a changing climate due to global warming, what other adaptations would facilitate this species&#39; response to changing climates or to local changes in the environment? (1 pt)</p></li>
<li><p>In this assignment and throughout this course, we have focused more on HOW to do things in R rather than the intricicies of applying correct statistical tests and testing data for normality. How might your analysis change if you were doing this assignment for a statistics course or trying to submit if for publication? (1 pt)</p>

<p>Now go frolic through the meadow - you are free! It has been a pleasure teaching you this semester!</p></li>
</ol>

<h6 id="toc_13">Congrats on making it through this assignment and the semester! Hopefully you feel the power of your capabilities. This assignment is tailored from an actual publication, which will become visible on canvas after the deadline. Please note that unlike other assignments this project will not have any posted keys. You may check your answers against the results in the paper, and we will also be happy to go over any grades with anyone after the semester concludes for you to learn from any mistakes you may have made, but note that this will NOT change your grade unless an error is found.</h6>
